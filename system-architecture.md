2. **Component Architecture**
   - Input processing system
   - State tracking system
   - Suggestion engine
   - Pattern recognition system
   - User interface components

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Calendar systems
   - Communication tools
   - Note-taking systems
   - External data sources

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Technology stack considerations
   - Performance optimization
   - Security and privacy design
   - Deployment models

## MVP Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.13
- **Package Management**: uv (modern Python package manager)
- **Database**: ArangoDB with pyArango interface
- **API Layer**: FastAPI
- **CLI Interface**: Typer with Rich for enhanced terminal UI
- **LLM Integration**: Anthropic Claude API with Instructor for structured outputs
- **Voice Processing**: AssemblyAI for transcription, ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- **Prompt Management**: Promptify for template management
- **Testing**: pytest with recording/replay capabilities
- **Containerization**: Podman

### Core Components

1. **Data Layer**
   - ArangoDB for document and graph storage
   - Simple collections for entities (Projects, Activities, Ideas)
   - Graph connections for relationships
   - Basic state tracking

2. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI endpoints for CRUD operations
   - Pydantic models for validation
   - Hooks system for future extensibility

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Claude API for natural language understanding
   - Structured extraction patterns
   - Simple matching algorithms for state-based suggestions

4. **Voice Processing**
   - Asynchronous processing of voice recordings
   - Text-to-speech response generation
   - Apple Shortcuts integration for mobile access

5. **CLI Interface**
   - Command-driven workflow
   - Rich text formatting for readability
   - State visualization tools

### MVP Database Schema

```
# Core Collections
- projects: Cohesive efforts toward specific outcomes
- activities: Discrete units of work
- ideas: Early-stage thoughts
- values: Core principles
- states: Energy, focus, mood records
- anchors: Fixed time commitments

# Edge Collections
- supports: Activity supports Project
- part_of: Idea is part of Project
- depends_on: Activity depends on Activity
- suitable_for: Activity suitable for State
- aligns_with: Activity aligns with Value
```

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Data Foundation**
- ArangoDB setup and schema implementation
- Core CRUD operations
- Basic CLI interface
- Testing framework

**Phase 2: Intelligence Layer**
