# Adaptive Flow: Methodology Comparison Table

This reference table provides a comprehensive overview of how Adaptive Flow synthesizes concepts from established methodologies while addressing their limitations through psychological integration.

## Core Methodologies Comparison

| Aspect | Getting Things Done (GTD) | Just-in-Time (JIT) | Agile | Behavioral Activation (BA) | Adaptive Flow Synthesis |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------------|-------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Managing commitments | Managing flow | Managing iterative delivery | Managing mood through activity | Integrating wellbeing with productivity |
| **Basic Unit** | Next actions | Work items | User stories/tasks | Value-based activities | State-appropriate activities |
| **Organization System** | Projects & contexts | Kanban boards | Sprints & backlogs | Activity scheduling | Dynamic suggestion based on state |
| **Time Approach** | Context-appropriate timing | Pull when ready | Time-boxed iterations | Regular engagement regardless of mood | State-based selection with anchors |
| **Planning Model** | Weekly/monthly reviews | Daily flow management | Sprint planning | Values-based scheduling | Adaptive suggestion with minimal planning |
| **Success Metric** | Mind like water | Smooth flow | Working software | Improved mood & functioning | Wellbeing + meaningful productivity |
| **Key Strength** | Comprehensive tracking | Optimized flow | Adaptability | Psychological effectiveness | Personalized balance |
| **Key Limitation** | Rigid contexts | Manufacturing origin | Team-oriented | Limited productivity focus | Complexity (addressed through technology) |

## Key Principles and Their Origins

| Adaptive Flow Principle | Primary Source | Secondary Influence | Psychological Integration |
|-------------------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Frictionless Capture** | GTD | | Reduces cognitive load & anxiety |
| **Contextual Organization** | GTD | JIT visualization | Incorporates psychological state as context |
| **Adaptive Suggestion** | | JIT pull systems | BA activity-mood matching |
| **Flow Optimization** | JIT continuous flow | | Flow psychology (Csikszentmihalyi) |
| **Collaborative Awareness** | Agile | GTD waiting-for lists | Relatedness need (Self-Determination Theory) |
| **Insightful Review** | GTD | Agile retrospectives | CBT pattern recognition |
| **Anchors** | | | Habit formation psychology, structured flexibility |
| **State-Based Selection** | | | BA state assessment & matching |
| **Idea Evolution Spaces** | | | Creative incubation psychology |
| **Values Connection** | | | ACT values framework, Self-Determination Theory |

## Limitation Mitigation

This table shows how Adaptive Flow addresses the limitations of each contributing methodology:

| Methodology | Key Limitation | Adaptive Flow Solution |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **GTD** | Fixed contexts don't account for mental state | States (energy, focus, mood) considered primary contexts |
| **GTD** | Review resistance due to structure | Flexible, insight-driven review process |
| **GTD** | Complex project-action relationships | Graph database model of interconnected entities |
| **JIT** | Assumes predictable processes | Adaptive to varying levels of definition and structure |
| **JIT** | Limited human factors consideration | Centers human factors (energy, focus, mood) |
| **Agile** | Team-oriented processes | Adapted for individual use while preserving collaboration |
| **Agile** | Sprint rigidity vs. creative flow | Anchor points with flexibility between |
| **BA** | Limited organizational framework | Enhanced with productivity methodology structure |
| **BA** | Manual activity selection | Technology-assisted suggestion and pattern recognition |

## Technology Integration Points

| System Component | Primary Methodology | Technology Enhancement |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Input Interpreter** | GTD capture | Natural language processing, entity recognition |
| **Idea Manager** | | Graph database connections, maturity assessment |
| **State Tracker** | BA | Pattern recognition, prediction algorithms |
| **Activity Suggester** | JIT, BA | Matching algorithms, learning from selections |
| **Flow Protector** | JIT, Flow Psychology | Context bundling, notification management |
| **Insight Generator** | Agile, CBT | Data analysis, pattern visualization |

This reference table can be used to understand both the philosophical and practical foundations of the Adaptive Flow system, illustrating how we've integrated the strongest elements of established methodologies while using psychological principles to address their limitations.
