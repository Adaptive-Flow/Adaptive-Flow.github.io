# Adaptive Flow LLM Primer

Adaptive Flow is a human-centered personal management system that harmonizes productivity with psychological wellbeing by dynamically matching activities to a person's current mental and physical states, rather than imposing rigid schedules.

## Core Concepts

- **State-Based Activity Selection**: Activities are matched to current energy, focus, and mood levels instead of fixed schedules.
- **Minimal Anchors**: Uses sparse fixed commitments ("anchors") for structure while preserving flexibility between them.
- **Organic Project Evolution**: Supports the natural progression from vague ideas to structured projects without forcing premature definition.
- **Values Integration**: Aligns daily activities with core personal values, treating wellbeing as equal to productivity.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies personal productivity and wellbeing patterns to improve suggestions over time.

## Philosophical Foundations

Adaptive Flow synthesizes elements from established methodologies (Getting Things Done, Just-in-Time, Agile) with psychological approaches (Flow Theory, Behavioral Activation, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) to create a system that works with human nature rather than against it.

It emphasizes:
- States over schedules
- Evolution over rigid definition
- Pull-based work selection over push-based assignment
- Balance across life domains over pure productivity
- Personal patterns over universal prescriptions

## Implementation Components

1. **AI Cognitive Partner**: Functions as a thinking collaborator that maintains extended context, identifies patterns, and adapts to the user's cognitive style.

2. **Graph-Based Data Structure**: Models connections between:
   - Projects (cohesive efforts toward outcomes)
   - Activities (discrete units of work)
   - Ideas (early-stage thoughts)
   - States (energy, focus, mood levels)
   - Anchors (fixed commitments)
   - Values (core principles)

3. **State Tracking**: Maintains awareness of current mental/physical state to inform activity suggestions.

4. **Flow Support**: Assembles context, minimizes distractions, and allows for natural work transitions rather than arbitrary time limits.

## Key Distinctions from Traditional Systems

Adaptive Flow differs from conventional productivity systems by:
- Working with natural cognitive rhythms instead of against them
- Supporting different mental states rather than assuming consistent capacity
- Preserving space for creative incubation and insight
- Learning from individual patterns rather than prescribing universal approaches
- Integrating wellbeing considerations directly into the workflow

This system is particularly valuable for knowledge workers with variable focus requirements, individuals managing complex responsibilities, and people seeking greater alignment between daily activities and personal values.
