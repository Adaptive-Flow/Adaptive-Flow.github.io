# Adaptive Flow: System Architecture

> *Note: This is a placeholder document for future development. The full system architecture documentation will be added in a later phase.*

## Overview

This document will provide technical details about how the Adaptive Flow system is architected, including:

- Data models and relationships
- System components and their interactions
- Technical implementation considerations
- Integration patterns
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Planned Sections

1. **Data Architecture**
   - Graph database structure
   - Entity relationships
   - State tracking models

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Input processing system
   - State tracking system
   - Suggestion engine
   - Pattern recognition system
   - User interface components

3. **Integration Architecture**
   - Calendar systems
   - Communication tools
   - Note-taking systems
   - External data sources

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Technology stack considerations
   - Performance optimization
   - Security and privacy design
   - Deployment models
